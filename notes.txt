First we want to try the function on the first element of our search list, then keep going until we have either; gone through our search list, and we accept or we break out either due to an incorrect value or an error.

functions (f1 ... fn)
search_list (s1 ... sn)

# Scenario 1
f1(s1) # Type fail
f2(s1) # passes
f2(s2) # fails wrong value, added to depth stack
f3(s1) # passes
f3(s2)
:
f3(sn) # passes, function accepted


# Scenario 2
f1(s1) # Type fail
f2(s1) # passes
f2(s2) # fails wrong value, added to depth stack
f3(s1) # passes
f3(s2) # fails wrong value
:
fn(s1) # Fails, but is last function
f1(f2(s1)) # Fails TypeError
f2(f2(s1)) # (note to look out for idempotence)
